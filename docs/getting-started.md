This is a proof of concept of a decentralized application for recording location data with IPFS storage and Filecoin backups via web3.storage, built on [Astral Logbook](https://github.com/DecentralizedGeo/astral-logbook).

## Functionality

It allows users to:
- record geotagged entries
- store log entries onchain
- include a text memo in their entries
- attach a file to their entries
